# Lightbox Application
A simple lightbox application using only native Javascript and Sass.

This makes a Flickr API call to the `flickr.photosets.getPhotos` endpoint, and returns one of my own photosets.

To run this code, first make sure you have Node installed. Then:

* Clone or download this repo
* Navigate to the lightbox-app folder, and run `npm install`
* After the packages are installed, run `npm start`
* Open a browser and view the app at `http://localhost:3000`

Tested on:
* Mac OSX: Firefox, Chrome, Safari
* Windows: IE 11, Edge 13, 14 (via [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/))
