# Lightbox Application
A simple lightbox application using only native Javascript and Sass.

This makes a Flickr API call to the `flickr.photosets.getPhotos` endpoint, and returns one of my own photosets.

To run this code, first make sure you have Node installed. Then:

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Navigate to the lightbox-app folder, and run `npm install`
3. After the packages are installed, run `npm start`
4. Open a browser and view the app at `http://localhost:3000`
